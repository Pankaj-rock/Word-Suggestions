In this we used the bigram and trigram models of nltk to fit the conditions of predictions upon single or multiple words.

We used the brown text corpora of nltk along with the Plaintextreader of nltk.
Also we used our own corpus to make suggestions.

For the quick suggestions we took the help of ajax so it gives the suggestions quickly.
